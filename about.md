Forever passionate about nature and traveling, my inspiration comes from these two things I like. Iâ€˜m really sensitive to my surroundings and I really value well crafted design that makes an impact on people. Design can make the world a lot more pleasant and this is my biggest challenge everyday.

I always listen to my clients, being flexible and understanding, but at the same time I think outside the box and try not to be predictable. I believe in quality, consistency and transparency and that the best part of collaborating is picking the best things each of us have to give.

Apart from work, I have a neverending plant collection and I'm always drinking a cup of tea. I like to make lists in my notebook, to explore new places, to bake some pancakes or cookies and to scroll around Pinterest and Instagram looking for some more inspiration.
