I’m a UI / UX designer based in Lisbon. I’ve specialised in crafting end-to-end digital experiences and I'm focused on delivering solutions that have a meaningful impact on people's lives. Taking projects from a holistic perspective, my sweet spot is where user needs meet highly polished and intuitive interfaces. 

As a team player, I find it inspiring to work with people with different skills and backgrounds that challenge me to broaden horizons. Check out my work!
